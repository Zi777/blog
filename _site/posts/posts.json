As one of the project deliverables, this assiganment is a sub-module (module 1) from our proposed project - Enabling optimization of Bike Sharing Operations – Bluebikes.\r\n2.0 Literature Review\r\nBased on Shayini, S. (2017, March 24). RPubs - Bike Sharing Data Analysis with R. RPubs. https://www.rpubs.com/shayini/bike_sharing, the analysis digs into data exploration aspect, we include geospatial data mapping in our project to enrich the data visualization. According to Low, C. T. (2018, September 5). Analysis and Visualization of Blue Bikes Sharing in Boston. DataScience+. https://datascienceplus.com/blue-bikes-sharing-in-boston/, the analysis and visualization were performed with mapping using leaflet. Specifically, dock stations are marked in map as well as trips in each dock station are present through heatmap. For dock stations distribution, popups function are used to show the name of the dock station by clicking, to enhance the user experience, we use the htmltool package to enable the label display by hovering house over a marker. As regard to the heatmap, the overall popularity of each dock station can be acquired, however we cannot gain the detailed trip number or station information from it. To narrow this gap, we intend to use dot density to represent the popularity of each dock station, and increase the interactivity by using cluster, on top of that, we add filters to allow us to investigate the usage of different type of users along one day.\r\n3.0 Data Preparation\r\n3.1 Install Packages\r\n3.0 Data Preparation\r\n3.1 Install Packages\r\nPackages required\r\nlibrary(data.table) # for faster loading on large dataset\r\nlibrary(tidyverse) # load ggplot, dplyr\r\nlibrary(leaflet) # interactive mapping\r\nlibrary(leaflet.extras) # extra mapping for leaflet\r\nlibrary(lubridate) # formatting date and time\r\nlibrary(gridExtra) # multiple plot arrange\r\nlibrary(grid) # multiple plot arrange\r\nlibrary(psych) # to get describe function\r\nlibrary(janitor) # to get tabulate variables function\r\nlibrary(htmltool) # for HTML generation and output\r\nlibrary(crosstalk) # for filter inputs\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('data.table','tidyverse','leaflet','leaflet.extras','lubridate','gridExtra','grid','psych','janitor', 'htmltools','crosstalk')\r\nfor (p in packages){\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n  install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p,character.only= T )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.2 Importing Data\r\n\r\n\r\n#load trip data\r\ntrip <- read_csv('data/202001-bluebikes-tripdata.csv')\r\n#load station data\r\nstation <- read.csv('data/current_bluebikes_stations.csv')\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.3 Checking the overview of the dataset\r\n\r\n\r\nglimpse(trip)\r\n\r\n\r\nRows: 128,598\r\nColumns: 15\r\n$ tripduration              <dbl> 478, 363, 284, 193, 428, 695, 1...\r\n$ starttime                 <dttm> 2020-01-01 00:04:05, 2020-01-0...\r\n$ stoptime                  <dttm> 2020-01-01 00:12:04, 2020-01-0...\r\n$ `start station id`        <dbl> 366, 219, 219, 396, 60, 372, 36...\r\n$ `start station name`      <chr> \"Broadway T Stop\", \"Boston East...\r\n$ `start station latitude`  <dbl> 42.34278, 42.37331, 42.37331, 4...\r\n$ `start station longitude` <dbl> -71.05747, -71.04102, -71.04102...\r\n$ `end station id`          <dbl> 93, 212, 212, 387, 49, 178, 23,...\r\n$ `end station name`        <chr> \"JFK/UMass T Stop\", \"Maverick S...\r\n$ `end station latitude`    <dbl> 42.32034, 42.36884, 42.36884, 4...\r\n$ `end station longitude`   <dbl> -71.05118, -71.03978, -71.03978...\r\n$ bikeid                    <dbl> 6005, 3168, 3985, 2692, 4978, 5...\r\n$ usertype                  <chr> \"Customer\", \"Subscriber\", \"Subs...\r\n$ `birth year`              <dbl> 1969, 2000, 2001, 1978, 1987, 1...\r\n$ gender                    <dbl> 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0...\r\n\r\n3.4 Data Wrangling\r\n\r\n\r\n# Convert second to minutes and round it non decimal points\r\ntrip$minutes <- round(trip$tripduration/60, 0)\r\n\r\n# Calculate the age from birth year\r\ntrip$age <- 2020 -

On top of that, we use both dot size and dot color to represent the number of trip for each station. Right click the circle to zoom in and acquire the dock station name and number of trip.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Make mapping color palette for numerical variables\r\npopularity<-tabyl(trip_data, start_name)\r\ncPal<-colorNumeric(palette = \"YlOrRd\", domain = popularity$n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#starting location\r\n#mapping\r\ntrip_data %>% \r\n  leaflet() %>%\r\n  setView(lng = -71.0589, lat = 42.3601, zoom = 13) %>% \r\n  addTiles() %>%\r\n  addCircleMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),\r\n                   lng = trip_data$start_long, \r\n                   lat = trip_data$start_lat,\r\n                   color = cPal(popularity$n),\r\n                   stroke = FALSE,\r\n                   radius = sqrt(popularity$n)/5,\r\n                   fillOpacity = 1,\r\n                   popup = paste('Station:',trip_data$start_name, '<br>',\r\n                           'Number of trips:',popularity$n))\r\n\r\n\r\npreservefc3a3b52f4b58428\r\n\r\n4.4 Dot Density Map with Filter\r\nTo shrink the data size and select the data according to our analyzing purpose, we add filters to the dot density map, with that we are able to visualize the changes in number of trip for each station through the day as well as difference between two types of user.\r\n\r\n\r\n#starting location\r\n#mapping\r\nshared_trip<-SharedData$new(trip_data)\r\nbscols(widths=c(3,9),\r\n  list(\r\n    filter_checkbox(\"usertype\", \"User Type\", shared_trip, ~usertype, columns = 1),\r\n    filter_slider(\"hour\", \"Hour of Day\", shared_trip, ~hour, step=1)\r\n  ),\r\n  leaflet(shared_trip) %>%\r\n  setView(lng = -71.0589, lat = 42.3601, zoom = 13) %>% \r\n  addTiles() %>%\r\n  addCircleMarkers(lng = trip_data$start_long, \r\n                   lat = trip_data$start_lat,\r\n                   color = cPal(popularity$n),\r\n                   stroke = FALSE,\r\n                   radius = sqrt(popularity$n)/5,\r\n                   fillOpacity = 1,\r\n                   popup = paste('Station:',trip_data$start_name, '<br>',\r\n                           'Number of trips:',popularity$n)) %>%\r\n  addLegend(\"bottomright\", pal = cPal, values = ~popularity$n,\r\n      title = \"Number of Trip\",\r\n      opacity = 1)\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\npreserve7844452037baa013\r\n\r\n5.0 Storyboard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Critiques and Suggestions for Current Visualization\r\n\r\nClarity\r\nRegard to the geographical map, it's hard for readers to gauge the frequency level solely by observing the dot density.\r\nDots in geographical map are overlapped, resulting in events with low frequency such as ‘Riots’ and ‘Strategic developments’ cannot be easily recognized.\r\nRefer to line charts, different ranges are used for y-axes, therefore the trend of data cannot be accurately reflected. For instance, compare with other event types, changes in ‘Riots’ are relatively minor, however they are magnified because of the range of y-axis. On top of that, the name of y-axis may cause confusion as we cannot see ‘Sheet1’\r\nThe data source of charts is not indicated.\r\nAesthetics\r\nOverall, the use of font, font size, and font color are clear, except the title can be in bold or in a darker color to be better highlighted.\r\nThe legend as well as the x-axis of the line chart is not fully displayed, it can be improved by restructuring the layout of the dashboard.\r\nInteractivity\r\nTo visual the geographical distribution, readers can only choose one country at a time instead of comparing the frequency of armed conflicts among different countries, since single-valued filter button is used for both charts.\r\nThe use of dynamic title can well convey the current country selected.\r\n2. Proposed Design of Alternative Data Visualization\r\n\r\n3. Data Visualization Steps\r\nWorksheet - Trend by Year\r\nDrag ‘Event Date’ and ‘Event Id Cnty’ to Columns and Rows respectively and set Measure of ‘Event Id Cnty’ as Count.\r\n\r\nDrag ‘Country’ to Filters and select Show Filter from the drop-down list. Change filter type to Single Value (list).\r\n\r\nDrag ‘Event Type’ to Filters and select Show Filter from the drop-down list. Change filter type to Single Value (list).\r\n\r\nSet Marks as ‘Bar’, then edit color, size and opacity of bars.\r\n\r\nDrag ‘Event Id Cnty’ to Rows and set Measure of ‘Event Id Cnty’ as Count.\r\n\r\nSet Marks as ‘Line’, then edit color, size and opacity of line.\r\n\r\nRight click the y-axis of line chart and select Dual Axis, then right click the merged y-axis and select Synchronize Axis.\r\n\r\nDrag ‘Event Type’ and ‘Country’ to Tooltip.\r\n\r\nEdit axes and add title to Worksheet ‘Trend by Year’ by double clicking.\r\n\r\nWorksheet - Stacked Bar Chart\r\nDrag ‘Event Type’ to Color.\r\n\r\nDrag ‘Event Id Cnty’ and ‘Country’ to Columns and Rows respectively and set Measure of ‘Event Id Cnty’ as ‘Count’.\r\n\r\nSort ‘Country’ by Count ‘Event Id Cnty’ Field using descending order.\r\n\r\nSet Marks as ‘Bar’, then edit color and opacity of stacked bars.\r\n\r\nEdit x-axis by right clicking, change the title of x-axis to ‘Number of Events’.\r\nAdjust the size of Worksheet ‘Trend by Year’ and use as visualization in Tooltip.\r\n\r\nAdd title to Worksheet ‘Stacked Bar Chart’ by double clicking.\r\nWorksheet - Map\r\nDrag ‘Longitude’ and ‘Latitude’ to Columns and Rows respectively.\r\n\r\nClick on Fix Map icon and adjust the size of map to show all eight countries.\r\n\r\nDrag ‘Event Id Cnty’ to Color and Size and set measure of both to Count. Then Drag ‘Country’ and ‘Location’ to Detail.\r\n\r\nDrag ‘Event Type’ to Filters and select Show Filter from the drop-down list. Change filter type to Single Value (list).\r\n\r\nSet the Background Maps to Dark.\r\n\r\nEdit color, opacity and size.\r\n\r\nEdit Tooltip.\r\n\r\nAdd title to Worksheet ‘Map’ by double clicking.\r\nFinal Dashboard\r\nCreate a new Dashboard and drag in Worksheet ‘Stacked Bar Chart’ as well as Worksheet ‘Map’ while pressing Shift key.\r\nAdjust size of worksheets and layout of Dashboard.\r\nUse Worksheet ‘Stacked Bar Chart’ as Filter\r\n\r\nFormat Worksheets by right clicking to make background color consistent.\r\nAdd title, text and data source.\r\n4. Final Visualization Output\r\n\r\n5. Major Insights\r\nDuring ten years from 2010 to 2020, Philippines, Myanmar, and Thailand have relatively great number of armed conflicts, while Lao, Malaysia and Vietnam have much less armed conflicts among all the listed countries.\r\nViolence against civilians is the most prominent conflict type in Philippines, and protests account for a great amount in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nProtests happened during 2010-2020 are scattered in other countries, but mostly concentrated in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.\r\n\r\nBattles happened during 2010-2020 are mainly concentrated on northeast of Myanmar and south most of Thailand, both are around borders, while scatter all over Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn Thailand, the number of armed conflicts fluctuated during 2010-2020, and reached at peak in 2013. On top of that, number of protests rose sharply from 2019 to 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Critiques and Suggestions for Current Visualization\r\n\r\nClarity\r\nThe title of the chart on the left side does not well revealed by the visualization, since the percentage of “1 - Strongly agree” is disordered. (Suggestion: It could be more informative if we either highlight the highly pro-vaccine countries or use descending order to display the percentage of “1 - Strong agree”.)\r\nAs some of the subgroups (degrees of agreement) have similar percentage, therefore the length of their bars cannot be easily distinguished through observation. (Suggestion: Add labels to indicate the percentage of each subgroups.)\r\nBy referring to the chart on the left side we cannot obviously differentiate negative opinions form positive ones. (Suggestion: It can be improved by using Gantt bar to show negative values on x-axis and present the negative opinion on the corresponding side.)\r\nRegard to the chart on the left, it's hard for readers to gauge the statistical level for countries such as Australia, Canada and Denmark etc., since they are further from the x-axis with different starting points for each subgroup. (Suggestion: It would be more readable to add gridlines to extend the vertical axes across the chart.)\r\nThe legend of the chart may cause confusions, because for “2”, “3”, and “4”, the degrees of agreement are not indicated specifically. (Suggestion: To clarify the degrees of agreement as well as make the legend consistent, “2”, “3”, and “4” can be modified to “2 – Agree”, “3 – Neutral”, and “4 – Disagree”.)\r\nThe data source of charts is not indicated. (Suggestion: Provide the link of data source at the left corner to make the visualization complete.)\r\nAesthetics\r\nOverall, the use of font, font size, and font color are clear, and the layout is well-structured. (Suggestion: Keep it this way.)\r\nThe initial letter of country name is in lower case. (Suggestion: Capitalize the initial letter of country name as proper nouns.)\r\nThe bar chart on the right side is shown in one color which can be improved for better differentiation. (Suggestion: Use various colors to represent for each country or according to their degree of pro-vaccine.)\r\nThe digital places of x-axis for two charts are inconsistent. (Suggestion: Keep one or zero digital place for both to make them coordinate.)\r\n2. Proposed Design of Alternative Data Visualization**\r\n\r\n3. Data Visualization Steps**\r\nData Import\r\nUnzip all the zip files and put them in the same folder, then drag australia.csv into Tableau, the Tableau will automatically recognize all the csv files in the folder. We can add other country's data files by double clicking “New Union”.\r\n\r\nData Preparation\r\nKeep “household_size”, “vac_2” and “Table Name” and hide other columns.\r\nAdd Filter to “vac_2” and deselect null values.\r\n\r\nRename “Table Name” to “Country”.\r\nCreate calculation filed named “Score” to extract numbers from “vac_2”, and replace “1 – Strongly Agree” to “5” and so on. Then convert “Score” to dimension.\r\n\r\nEdit aliases for “Score” and “Country”.\r\n\r\nThe dataset looks like below after tidying up.\r\n\r\nTableau Works\r\nCreate calculation filed named “Number of Records”.\r\n\r\nCreate calculation filed named “Total Count”.\r\n\r\nCreate calculation filed named “Percentage”.\r\n\r\nCreate calculation filed named “Count Negative”.\r\n\r\nCreate calculation filed named “Total Count Negative”.\r\n\r\nCreate calculation filed named “Gantt Start”.\r\n\r\nCreate calculation filed named “Gantt Percent”.\r\n\r\nChange default property type of “Percentage” and “Gantt Percent” to percentage and keep one decimal place.\r\nDrag “Gantt Percent” to “Column”, and “Country” to “Row”. Then add “Score” to “Color”. After that, edit table calculation for “Gantt Percent” and computing using “Score”. Last but not least, change “Automatic” to “Gantt Bar”.\r\n\r\nAdd “Percentage” to “Size”.\r\nAdd “household_size” to “Filter”, then uncheck “Don't know” and “Prefer not to say”. After that, clicking on “Show Filter”. Finally set “Single Value (list)” for filter button.\r\nChange colors to beautify the view.\r\nAdd title and caption for data source.\r\n4. Final Visualization Output\r\n\r\n5. Major Insights\r\nThe percentage of “Strongly disagree” for France accounts for a relatively great percentage among all the countries and household size, and the Gantt bar tend to the left side, which indicate severe mood of anti-vaccination.\r\nThe percentage of “Strongly agree” for Denmark accounts for a relatively great percentage among all the countries and household size, and the Gantt bar tend to the right side, which means Denmark is more pro-vaccine.\r\nAs the size of the household grows, the percentage of “Strongly agree” decreases for most of the countries, as well as the Gantt bar moves from the right to the left. Therefore, families with less people are more supportive for vaccination, and this could because of financial reasons, education levels etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Critiques and Suggestions for Current Visualization \r\n1.1 Clarity\r\na. The title of the chart does not well convey the purpose of this visualization, it could be more informative if the title includes the specific aspect that the chart reflects.\r\nSuggestion: In fact, the chart shows the percentage of labor force of each age group account for, therefore, the title can be modified to “Proportion of Resident Labor Force by Age”.\r\nb. The aim of this visualization is to reflect the movement of labor force age cohort. In this case, the population is mainly grouped into “labor force aged 25 to 54” and “labor force aged 55 & over”. However, this two groups cannot be obviously differentiated. Additionally, the cumulative proportion of this two age groups cannot be acquired directly from the chart.\r\nSuggestion: Therefore it’s bse dividing line or different colors to depict the two main age groups. Add labels for the cumulative proportion for each group.\r\nc. As the major insight of this visualization is that the median age of labor force rose from 41 to 44. The reference lines indicate the median age of each year and are distinguished by color correspondingly, which facilitate easy comparison and observation.\r\nSuggestion: Keep it this way.\r\nd. The chart skips the y-axis by putting the percentage of each age group below, to directly perceive the data, presenting numbers in form of visualization would be more useful for readers to gauge the statistical level. Moreover, these values provided in chart are not solely based on or derived from the suggested data source — Table 5: RESIDENT LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE BY AGE AND SEX, 2009 – 2019 (JUNE).\r\nSuggestion: This visualization needs to reflect the amount of data as well as the trend of the data, therefore it can be improved by using a combination of histogram and line chart.\r\ne. The note at the bottom indicates the rounding issue, which is good. However, the use of the words “may not” is not statistically precise.\r\nSuggestion: The content of the note can be changed to “The figures are rounding to one decimal place”.\r\n1.2 Aesthetics\r\na. Overall the use of font, font size, and font color are clear, and the layout is well-structured.\r\nSuggestion: Keep it this way.\r\nb. The colors used to represent two different years seems close, which can be improved to highlight.\r\nSuggestion: Use colors with higher degree of contrast.\r\nc. The Source is at the bottom center while the Note is at the bottom left, which seems not neat.\r\nSuggestion: Align the Source with Note at the bottom left.\r\n2. Proposed Design of Alternative Data Visualization\r\n3. Data Visualization Steps\r\nData Preparation\r\n1. Delete the entire empty row in the raw data (mrsd_2019LabourForce_T5.xlsx), to avoid the null values in further steps.\r\n\r\n2. Import raw data to Tableau and select T5_T table.\r\n3.Due to the format of raw data, after Dragging the excel file (mrsd_2019LabourForce_T5.xlsx) into Tableau, we can see that the imported data contains many null values as well as a lot of other information. To tidy up the dataset, we check the box in front of “Use Data Interpreter”. Then it will automatically exclude the unrelated data.\r\n\r\nSince the first column still contains null values and texts, thus we hide the entire column. \r\n4. Press the Ctrl key to select all column except “Age (Years)1”, then create pivot table by right clicking.\r\n\r\nChange the column names accordingly.\r\n\r\nTableau Works\r\n1. Create the “Labor Participation Rate” calculation field to change the data format of “Participation Rate” into percentage.\r\n\r\n2. Create the “Rank” calculation field by right clicking the empty filed of “Data”.\r\n\r\n3. Drag “Labor Participation Rate” into “Columns”, and “Rank” into “Rows”. Set “Rank” as discrete.\r\n\r\n4. Put “Age Group” into Marks – Label.\r\n\r\n5. Select “Edit Table Calculation” by right clicking “Rank”, then select “Specific Dimensions” in the pop-up window.\r\n\r\n6. Drag “Year” into “Pages” and change the property into Year. Edit title accordingly. \r\n\r\n7. Put “Age Group”, “Rank”, and “YEAR(Year)” to Filters, so that we can edit filters according to our focus.\r\n\r\n8. Edit color of “Age Group”, use darker color for elder group. \r\n9. Create lollipop chart, firstly Drag “Labor Participation Rate” into “Columns”.\r\n\r\n10.Right click the x-axis on the right side and select “Dual Axis”\r\n\r\n11. Mark one “Labor Participation Rate” as Bar and another as “Circle”. \r\n12. Right clicking the x-axis and select “Synchronize Axis”\r\n\r\n13. Adjust the position, size and color of labels to fit the view.\r\n14. Add reference line by right clicking the x-axis to show the average participation rate. \r\n15. Add caption to indicate the data source.\r\n4. Final Visualization Output \r\n5. Major Insights\r\na. While selecting the year from 2009 to 2019, we can observe that the reference line shifts to the right gradually, which means the average labor force participation rate increased over the year, from 62.73% to 67.97%.\r\nb. We use the light blue represents the young labor force (aged from 15-24), the azure represents the meddle-aged labor force (aged from 25-54), and the dark blue for the elder labor force (55 & over). By selecting the year from 2009 to 2019, we can observe that although the labor force participation rate of the elder age cohort increased, the labor force participation rate of middle-aged labor force remained the top, which indicates that middle-aged labor force is the main composition of labor force.\r\nc. Labor force participation rate of 20 - 24 ranked as 8 in 2009, which is surpassed by Labor force participation rate of 55 – 64 and decreased from 63.50% to 61.0%. Based on this, we can infer that the overall age of labor force has increased along the years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
